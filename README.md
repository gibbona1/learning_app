- [ ] Testing
    - [ ] https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/
    - [ ] Backend (Node.js/Express API)
        - [ ] Unit Tests:
            - [ ] Use Jest for testing individual functions and logic.
            - [ ] Create mocks and stubs for external services and databases to isolate unit tests.
        - [ ] Route/Integration Tests:
            - [ ] Use Supertest with Jest to test your Express routes.
            - [ ] Write tests to make HTTP requests to your API endpoints and assert the responses.
        - [ ] Database Seed Scripts:
            - [ ] Create scripts to seed your database with dummy data before tests.
            - [ ] Write cleanup scripts to remove test data after testing.
        - [ ] Mocking and Stubs:
            - [ ] Utilize Jest to mock external modules and services.
            - [ ] Create stubs for database interactions to avoid hitting the actual database in tests.
        - [ ] Code Coverage:
            - [ ] Use Istanbul (nyc) with Jest to generate code coverage reports.
            - [ ] Aim for high code coverage while ensuring tests are meaningful.
    - [ ] Frontend Testing (React Components)
        - [ ] Unit and Component Tests:
            - [ ] Use Jest and React Testing Library to test individual components.
            - [ ] Test component rendering and user interactions.
        - [ ] Mocking Hooks and Contexts:
            - [ ] Mock custom hooks and context providers if necessary to isolate components for testing.
        - [ ] Snapshot Testing:
            - [ ] Optionally use Jest's snapshot testing to ensure UI does not change unexpectedly.
    - [ ] End-to-End Testing
        - [ ] Cypress or Puppeteer:
            - [ ] Set up Cypress or Puppeteer for end-to-end testing.
            - [ ] Write tests that simulate real user interactions from the frontend through to the backend.
    - [ ] Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
        - [ ] Setup CI/CD Pipeline:
            - [ ] Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI.
            - [ ] Configure the pipeline to run tests on every push or pull request.
            - [ ] Automate deployment on successful builds/tests to staging or production environments.
